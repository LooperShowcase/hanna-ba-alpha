          NASA was established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory
          Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The new agency was to have a
          distinctly civilian orientation, encouraging peaceful applications in
          space science.[7][8][9] Since its establishment, most US space
          exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon
          landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space
          Shuttle. NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is
          overseeing the development of the Orion spacecraft, the Space Launch
          System, Commercial Crew vehicles, and the planned Lunar Gateway space
          station. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services
          Program, which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown
          management for uncrewed NASA launches.

          SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded
          liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit (Falcon 1 in 2008), the first
          private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a
          spacecraft (Dragon in 2010), the first private company to send a
          spacecraft to the International Space Station (Dragon in 2012), the
          first vertical take-off and vertical propulsive landing for an orbital
          rocket (Falcon 9 in 2015), the first reuse of an orbital rocket
          (Falcon 9 in 2017), and the first private company to send astronauts
          to orbit and to the International Space Station (SpaceX Crew Dragon
          Demo-2 in 2020). SpaceX has flown and reflown the Falcon 9 series of
          rockets over one hundred times. SpaceX is developing a satellite
          megaconstellation named Starlink to provide commercial internet
          service. In January 2020 the Starlink constellation became the largest
          satellite constellation ever launched. SpaceX is also developing
          Starship, a privately funded, fully reusable, super heavy-lift launch
          system for interplanetary spaceflight. Starship is intended to become
          the primary SpaceX orbital vehicle once operational, supplanting the
          existing Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon fleet. Starship is planned
          to be fully reusable and will have the highest payload capacity of any
          orbital rocket ever on its debut, scheduled for the early 2020s.

        <summary>Atomic orbital</summary>
        <p>
          In atomic theory and quantum mechanics, an atomic orbital is a
          mathematical function describing the location and wave-like behavior
          of an electron in an atom.[1] This function can be used to calculate
          the probability of finding any electron of an atom in any specific
          region around the atom's nucleus. The term atomic orbital may also
          refer to the physical region or space where the electron can be
          calculated to be present, as predicted by the particular mathematical
          form of the orbital.[2] Each orbital in an atom is characterized by a
          unique set of values of the three quantum numbers n, ℓ, and
          ml,[dubious – discuss] which respectively correspond to the electron's
          energy, angular momentum, and an angular momentum vector component
          (the magnetic quantum number). Each such orbital can be occupied by a
          maximum of two electrons, each with its own projection of spin
          {\displaystyle m_{s}}m_{s}. The simple names s orbital, p orbital, d
          orbital, and f orbital refer to orbitals with angular momentum quantum
          number ℓ = 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively. These names, together with the
          value of n, are used to describe the electron configurations of atoms.
          They are derived from the description by early spectroscopists of
          certain series of alkali metal spectroscopic lines as sharp,
          principal, diffuse, and fundamental. Orbitals for ℓ > 3 continue
          alphabetically, omitting j (g, h, i, k, ...)[3][4][5] because some
          languages do not distinguish between the letters "i" and "j"
