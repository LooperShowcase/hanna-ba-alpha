          Debates concerning the nature, essence and the mode of existence of
          space date back to antiquity; namely, to treatises like the Timaeus of
          Plato, or Socrates in his reflections on what the Greeks called khôra
          (i.e. "space"), or in the Physics of Aristotle (Book IV, Delta) in the
          definition of topos (i.e. place), or in the later "geometrical
          conception of place" as "space qua extension" in the Discourse on
          Place (Qawl fi al-Makan) of the 11th-century Arab polymath Alhazen.[2]
          Many of these classical philosophical questions were discussed in the
          Renaissance and then reformulated in the 17th century, particularly
          during the early development of classical mechanics. In Isaac Newton's
          view, space was absolute—in the sense that it existed permanently and
          independently of whether there was any matter in the space.
